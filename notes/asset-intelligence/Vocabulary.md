Group Policy Object (GPO) is a collection of configuration settings in Active Directory (AD) that define how operating systems, applications, and user or computer accounts are managed within a domain . GPOs are applied to sites, domains, or organizational units (OUs) and enforce policies such as password rules, software installations, registry settings, file system permissions, and more.
