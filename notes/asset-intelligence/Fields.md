### Active Directory Fields

_These are fields that are of interest for correlation with exisiting data_

#### SID (Security Identifier)
Is a fundamental, unique, immutable identifier assigned to every security principal—that is, any user, group, computer account, or process—within a Windows environment
Permanent identity: Unlike usernames, which can be renamed, a SID remains constant, ensuring consistent security tracking .
  - Access control: SIDs are embedded in access tokens and used in Access Control Lists (ACLs) to grant or deny permissions to objects like files, printers, and registry entries

  - Domain consistency: When used in a domain, a SID is composed of a domain-wide identifier authority plus a Relative ID (RID) unique to the principal within that domain
  nordvpn.com+5learn.microsoft.com+5en.wikipedia.org+5
  - Immutability: SIDs are never reused—once a security principal is deleted, its SID isn’t reassigned to another entity

EX: VALIDATE This
S-Revision-IdentifierAuthority-SubAuthorities-RelativeIdentifier
- S indicates it's a SID.
- 1 is the revision level.
- 5 is the identifier authority (e.g., NT Authority).
- 21-... is the domain identifier (unique per domain or machine).
- Final number is the RID; e.g., 512 often refers to the Domain Admins group

#### objectSID 
attribute that stores a user/group/computer objects SID.
```text
During 
Get‑ADUser -Identity <username> | Select Name, SID
During authentication, Windows issues an access token containing the user’s SID and group SIDs. These are then evaluated against ACLs to determine resource access rights

### Okta

#### ipChain

Okta uses IP Zone Evaluation document and whitepaper that the ipAddress field is determined
by inspecting the ipChain (XFF header value and the last hop IP) and by extracting the first IP that is not in the “Trusted Proxy” setting.


Data Snippet:
```JSON
"ipChain": [
{
    "ip": "10.0.0.1",
    "geographicalContext":
        {},
        "version": "V4",
        "source": null
    }
]
```

### BloodHound

#### ACEs
Access Control Entries - individual permissions records that define what each security principal can/can't do to AD objects.
Shows the inheritance of how permissions propagate roughly (boolean)

##### **BloodHound relies on enumerating ACEs across all AD objects to map out ACL-based attack paths**
Data Snippet:
```JSON
'Aces': [{'PrincipalSID': 'S-1-5-21-2697957641-2271029196-387917394-512',
   'PrincipalType': 'Group',
   'RightName': 'Owns',
   'IsInherited': False},
  {'PrincipalSID': 'PHANTOM.CORP-S-1-5-32-544',
   'PrincipalType': 'Group',
   'RightName': 'WriteDacl',
   'IsInherited': False},...
   ```
