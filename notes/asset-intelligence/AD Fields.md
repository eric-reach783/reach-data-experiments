We can obtain device hardware information from Intune using the GraphAPI 1.0 Beta: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-devices-hardwareinformation?view=graph-rest-beta

There is an Endpoint to obtain all the manged devices, this can show us the intune decvices (serialNumber).

#### SID (Security Identifier)

Is a fundamental, unique, immutable identifier assigned to every security principal—that is, any user, group, computer account, or process—within a Windows environment
Permanent identity: Unlike usernames, which can be renamed, a SID remains constant, ensuring consistent security tracking .

- Access control: SIDs are embedded in access tokens and used in Access Control Lists (ACLs) to grant or deny permissions to objects like files, printers, and registry entries
  nordvpn.com+9techtarget.com+9activedirectorypro.com+9
- Domain consistency: When used in a domain, a SID is composed of a domain-wide identifier authority plus a Relative ID (RID) unique to the principal within that domain
  nordvpn.com+5learn.microsoft.com+5en.wikipedia.org+5
- Immutability: SIDs are never reused—once a security principal is deleted, its SID isn’t reassigned to another entity
  en.wikipedia.org+15learn.microsoft.com+15sentinelone.com+15

```text
EX: VALIDATE This
S-Revision-IdentifierAuthority-SubAuthorities-RelativeIdentifier
- S indicates it's a SID.
- 1 is the revision level.
- 5 is the identifier authority (e.g., NT Authority).
- 21-... is the domain identifier (unique per domain or machine).
- Final number is the RID; e.g., 512 often refers to the Domain Admins group

```

The security context is generated using the users SID, rights, and SIDs for groups.

#### objectSID

attribute that stores a user/group/computer objects SID.

```text
During 
Get‑ADUser -Identity <username> | Select Name, SID
During authentication, Windows issues an access token containing the user’s SID and group SIDs. These are then evaluated against ACLs to determine resource access rights
